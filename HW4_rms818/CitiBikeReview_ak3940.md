### Hypotheses:
Your hypotheses look solid, but you're missing the equations.

It also might be better to leave out the "in Jan 2016" part. Considering that we already have all the data for January 2016, we don't really need to use a hypothesis test to figure out if average female trip duration was lower or higher than average male trip duration for that specific month.

You could expand the scope of your hypothesis to say, "trip duration of females on average is equal or higher than trip duration of males on average". Then you could maybe include one or two more months of ridership data when the overall riding behavior is different (i.e. in March or June when the weather is probably better and more people are out riding). This way your hypothesis test becomes more generalizable.

### Data:
Your data looks nice and tidy. :)

### Hypothesis Test:
You didn't include a hypothesis test (maybe for the reason I mentioned in the 'Hypothesis' section?), but in this case a t-test should be good for you since you're comparing the averages of two groups.
